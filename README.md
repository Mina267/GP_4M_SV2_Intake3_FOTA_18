Firmware Over-The-Air (FOTA) is a project aimed at enabling remote updates of
firmware on embedded devices. It provides a mechanism to deploy software patches,
and feature enhancements to devices in the field without requiring physical access.
FOTA simplifies the process of keeping devices up to date, improving functionality,
security, and reliability. By leveraging wireless communication channels, FOTA
minimizes downtime and reduces the need for manual interventions, making it a
valuable tool for managing firmware across many distributed devices.
